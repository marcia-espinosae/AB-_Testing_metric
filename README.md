Key performance indicators (KPIs)

The A/B testing metrics you need to track depend on the hypothesis you want to test and your business goals. 

For example, an ecommerce website may run an A/B test to decrease cart abandonment, whereas a software company might test various call-to-action (CTA) button variations on a landing page to boost free sign-ups. The metrics or A/B testing KPIs to monitor for both scenarios would differ. 

1. Click-through rate (CTR)
Click-through rate or CTR is the percentage of clicks on a specific link compared to the total number of times the link was shown (also called impressions). This metric helps evaluate the relevance of clickable website elements like CTA buttons and navigation links to your target audience. 

**How to calculate CTR**

CTR = (Clicks / Impressions) x 100

**How to improve CTR**
While there is no universal way to increase the CTR on a website, the following tips help:

* Optimize the visibility and placement of clickable elements like the search bar by placing them in prominent areas, e.g. a web page’s top or side panel

* Use persuasive language on CTAs

* Make important elements stand out with bold colors or eye-catching images 

* Improve the product messaging so it entices readers to learn more about your offering

2. Bounce rate

Bounce rate represents the percentage of visitors entering your website but quickly leaving without taking additional actions, such as clicking a link. These instances are called single-page sessions. 

Bounce rate is a good indicator of visitor interest and reveals website design or content problems, giving you more insight into your experiment control and variant’s effectiveness.

High bounce rates affect your bottom line if your business’s growth depends on users exploring multiple pages before making a buying decision. For instance: 

A dentist's website would require just a few landing pages or blogs to attract clients 

A software startup's website catering to a global audience might need a comprehensive content library to attract customers via Google Search and educate their audience

**How to calculate bounce rate**

Website bounce rate = Single-page sessions / Total sessions

You can find this information in traditional analytics tools like Google Analytics.

**How to reduce bounce rate**

* Adjust the messaging and placement of any website copy communicating the value of your website and encouraging visitors to stick around

* Improve page load speed so visitors don’t get frustrated and navigate to another website

* Enhance the user experience (UX) by improving your website’s navigation

3. Conversion rate
Conversion rate is the percentage of users who take a desired action (or convert) on your website. A ‘conversion’ could be clicking on a particular link, signing up for your service, or buying a product. It’s one of the most common—and crucial—metrics for measuring A/B test success.

**How to calculate conversion rate**

Divide the total number of desired actions taken (conversions) by the total number of website visitors and multiply the outcome by 100.

Conversion rate = (Number of conversions / Total number of visitors) x 100

**How to improve conversion rate**

* Delve deep into your audience's psyche and identify the touchpoints that led them to your website so you can address their pain points in your messaging

* Add social proof elements like customer reviews and testimonials to build trust and credibility

* Determine triggers preventing users from converting—and persuading others to buy—so you can double down on your highest-converting flows

Note: conversion rate optimization (CRO) depends on many factors, and the points we mentioned above are just the tip of the iceberg. CRO fundamentals are developing a solid understanding of your target audience and showing them why they should buy from you.

4. Scroll depth

Scroll depth measures how far down a web page a user scrolls, revealing a page’s most engaging parts and its drop-off points. Use scroll depth data to make informed decisions on improving user engagement and conversions, such as optimizing content and design elements for an A/B test.

**How to calculate scroll depth**

Use Hotjar Heatmaps to generate detailed scroll maps and identify how far users scroll down a web page to discover where you’re losing users’ attention. 

Red represents the areas on your page users engage with the most, while blue represents low or no customer interaction.

**How to improve scroll depth**

* Make your pages scannable with smart use of headings, formatting, images, and charts

* Use a table of contents for longer articles to encourage scrolling

* Experiment with design elements like headings, colors, and image placement to see what works best for your audience and drives more engagement
