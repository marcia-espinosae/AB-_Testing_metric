Key performance indicators (KPIs)

The A/B testing metrics you need to track depend on the hypothesis you want to test and your business goals. 

For example, an ecommerce website may run an A/B test to decrease cart abandonment, whereas a software company might test various call-to-action (CTA) button variations on a landing page to boost free sign-ups. The metrics or A/B testing KPIs to monitor for both scenarios would differ.
